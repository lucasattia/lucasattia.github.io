I am PhD researcher in chemical engineering at [MIT](https://cheme.mit.edu/) working in the [Doyle Group](https://doylegroup.mit.edu/) funded as a [DOE Computational  Science Graduate Fellow](https://www.krellinst.org/csgf/about-doe-csgf). My thesis combines expertise in nanotechnology, molecular simulation, and cheminformatics towards engineering approaches in small molecule nanoformulation to enable oral bioavailability. I am passionate about leveraging computational modeling to guide, inform, and accelerate the design of novel materials and processes. An accomplished scientific communicator, I have contributed to 8 peer-reviewed publications and over 41 presentations at conferences and symposia, and have delivered 12 award-winning presentations. I enjoy fostering collaboration and mentorship within research environments.

I earned my undergraduate degree at the University of Delaware in the department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, with minors in Computer Science and Chemistry. There, I worked in the [Fromen Research Group](https://sites.udel.edu/cfromen/research/) on nanoparticle drug delivery and fluid transport modeling through cellular foams.
