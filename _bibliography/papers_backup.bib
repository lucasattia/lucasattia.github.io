  abstract = "Nanosizing drug crystals has emerged as a successful approach to
              enabling oral bioavailability, as increasing drug crystal surface
              area improves dissolution kinetics and effective solubility.
              Recently, bottom-up methods have been developed to directly
              assemble nanosized crystals by leveraging polymer and surfactant
              excipients during crystallization to control crystal size,
              morphology, and structure. However, while significant research
              has investigated how polymers and other single additives inhibit
              or promote crystallization in pharmaceutical systems, there is
              little work studying the mechanistic interactions of multiple
              excipients on drug crystal structure and the extent of
              crystallinity, which can influence formulation performance. This
              study explores how the structure and crystallinity of a model
              hydrophobic drug crystal, fenofibrate, change as a result of
              competitive interfacial chemisorption between common nonionic
              surfactants (polysorbate 80 and sorbitan monooleate) and a
              surface-active polymer excipient (methylcellulose). Classical
              molecular dynamics simulations highlight how key intermolecular
              interactions, including surfactant-polymer complexation and
              surfactant screening of the crystal surface, modify the resulting
              crystal structure. In parallel, experiments generating drug
              nanocrystals in hydrogel thin films validate that drug
              crystallinity increases with an increasing weight fraction of
              surfactant. Simulation results reveal a connection between
              accelerated dynamics in the bulk crystal and the experimentally
              measured extent of crystallinity. To our knowledge, these are the
              first simulations that directly characterize structural changes
              in a drug crystal as a result of excipient surface composition
              and relate the experimental extent of crystallinity to structural
              changes in the molecular crystal. Our approach provides a
              mechanistic understanding of crystallinity in
              nanocrystallization, which can expand the range of orally
              deliverable small molecule therapies.",

  abstract = "Porous media have long been used for chemical engineering
              applicationsthat require mass and heat transfer, including
              catalysis and separations. Recently, additive manufacturing has
              allowed for the design of structured mesoscale porous structures,
              including open cellular structures and lattices,which can be used
              for applications ranging from biomedical implants to drug
              delivery to aeroelastic wing design. These structures have also
              garnered interest as a means to generate ordered porous media
              which can exhibit desired surface properties and imparts
              predictability. However, limited work has investigated the flow
              dynamics through these structures. This thesis leveraged
              computational fluid dynamics (CFD) as a tool to simulate fluid
              flow through open cellular structures. The flow phenomena through
              individual unit cells was investigated, and flow conditioning
              through unit cell pores was observed. The influence of unit cell
              geometry and flow conditions on pressure drop was also
              investigated for cubic unit cells. Theoretical model fits were
              evaluated, and it was found that the Darcy-Weisbach model may be
              a useful tool to evaluate pressure drop over individual unit
              cells. Pressure drop was shown to be decoupled for cubic unit
              cells under laminar flow in lattice structures, suggesting the
              feasibility of implementing optimization for the design of
              lattice structures with specific flow dynamics. Finally, a
              portable optimization workflow was developed to optimize lattice
              designs with a minimum pressure drop.",

              with high degrees of complexity and pre-defined structure.
              Lattices are one class of additive-only structures which have
              great potential in directing transport phenomena because they are
              highly ordered, scalable, and modular. However, a comprehensive
              description of how these structures scale and interact in
              heterogeneous systems is still undetermined. To advance this aim,
              we designed cubic and Kelvin lattices at two sub-5 mm length
              scales and compared published correlations to the experimental
              pressure gradient in pipes ranging from 12-52 mm diameter. We
              further investigated all combinations of the four lattices to
              evaluate segmented combinatorial behavior. The results suggest
              that a single correlation can describe pressure behavior for
              different lattice geometries and scales. Furthermore, combining
              lattice systems in series has a complex effect that is sensitive

  abstract = "Hydrophobic active pharmaceutical ingredients are ubiquitous in
              the drug development pipeline, but their poor bioavailability
              often prevents their translation into drug products. Industrial
              processes to formulate hydrophobic APIs are expensive, difficult
              to optimize, and not flexible enough to incorporate customizable
              drug release profiles into drug products. Here, a novel,
              dual-responsive gelation process that exploits orthogonal
              thermo-responsive and ion-responsive gelations is introduced.
              This one-step ``dual gelation'' synthesizes core-shell
              (methylcellulose-alginate) hydrogel particles and encapsulates
              drug-laden nanoemulsions in the hydrogel matrices. In situ
              crystallization templates drug nanocrystals inside the polymeric
              core, while a kinetically stable amorphous solid dispersion is
              templated in the shell. Drug release is explored as a function of
              particle geometry, and programmable release is demonstrated for
              various therapeutic applications including delayed pulsatile
              release and sequential release of a model fixed-dose combination
              drug product of ibuprofen and fenofibrate. Independent control
              over drug loading between the shell and the core is demonstrated.
              This formulation approach is shown to be a flexible process to
              develop drug products with biocompatible materials, facile
              synthesis, and precise drug release performance. This work

  abstract = "Developing novel drug carriers for pulmonary delivery is
              necessary to achieve higher efficacy and consistency for treating
              pulmonary diseases while limiting off-target side effects that
              occur from alternative routes of administration. Metal-organic
              frameworks (MOFs) have recently emerged as a class of materials
              with characteristics well-suited for pulmonary drug delivery,
              with chemical tunability, high surface area, and pore size, which
              will allow for efficient loading of therapeutic cargo and deep
              lung penetration. UiO-66, a zirconium and terephthalic acid-based
              MOF, has displayed notable chemical and physical stability and
              potential biocompatibility; however, its feasibility for use as a
              pulmonary drug delivery vehicle has yet to be examined. Here, we
              evaluate the use of UiO-66 nanoparticles (NPs) as novel pulmonary
              drug delivery vehicles and assess the role of missing linker
              defects in their utility for this application. We determined that
              missing linker defects result in differences in NP aerodynamics
              but have minimal effects on the loading of model and therapeutic
              cargo, cargo release, biocompatibility, or biodistribution. This
              is a critical result, as it indicates the robust consistency of
              UiO-66, a critical feature for pulmonary drug delivery, which is
              plagued by inconsistent dosage because of variable properties.
              Not only that, but UiO-66 NPs also demonstrate pH-dependent
              stability, with resistance to degradation in extracellular
              conditions and breakdown in intracellular environments.
              Furthermore, the carriers exhibit high biocompatibility and low
              cytotoxicity in vitro and are well-tolerated in in vivo murine
              evaluations of orotracheally administered NPs. Following
              pulmonary delivery, UiO-66 NPs remain localized to the lungs
              before clearance over the course of seven days. Our results
              demonstrate the feasibility of using UiO-66 NPs as a novel
              platform for pulmonary drug delivery through their tunable NP
              properties, which allow for controlled aerodynamics and

              excellent thermal and chemical stability and has functions in gas
              storage, catalysis, selective adsorption, and drug delivery.
              Though the stability of UiO-66 is highly advantageous,
              simultaneous synthetic control over particle size and
              defectiveness of UiO-66 remains difficult to attain. Using an
              acid-free solvothermal synthesis, we demonstrate that particle
              size, defectiveness, and inherent fluorescence of UiO-66 can be
              precisely tuned using the molar ligand to metal ratio, quantified
              water content, and reaction time during synthesis. These three
              synthetic handles allow for reproducible modulation of UiO-66
              defectiveness between 0 and 12\% and particle size between 20 to
              120 nm, while maintaining high crystallinity in the nanoparticles
              that were formed. We also find that particle defectiveness is
              linked to common over-estimation of particle size measurements
              obtained via dynamic light scattering (DLS) and propose a model
              to correct elevated hydrodynamic diameter measurements. Finally,
              we report inherent fluorescence of non-functionalized UiO-66,
              which exhibits peak fluorescence at a wavelength of 390 nm
              following excitation at 280 nm and is maximized in large,

Experimental determination of solubility is a time- and resource-intensive process and existing methods for \textit{in silico} estimation of solubility are limited by their generality, speed, and accuracy. This work presents two models derived from the fastprop and chemprop architectures and trained on BigSolDB which are capable of predicting solubility at arbitrary temperatures for a wide range of small molecules in organic solvent. Both extrapolate to unseen solutes 2-3 times more accurately than the current state-of-the-art model and we demonstrate that they are approaching the aleatoric limit (0.5-1 logS) of available test data, suggesting that further improvements in prediction accuracy require more accurate datasets. The fastprop-derived model (called fastsolv) and the chemprop-based model are open source, freely accessible via a Python package and web interface, highly reproducible, and up to 2 orders of magnitude faster than current alternatives."
